/**
 * Image formats.
 *
 * {component format}_{numeric format}
 *
 * - component format
 *   - indicates the size in bits of the R, G, B and A components if present
 * - numeric format
 *   - UNORM - unsigned normalize values, range [0, 1]
 *   - SNORM - signed normalized values, range [-1,1]
 *   - UINT - unsigned integer values, range [0,2n-1]
 *   - SINT - signed integer values, range [-2n-1,2n-1-1]
 *   - SFLOAT - signed floating-point numbers
 *   - SRGB - the R, G, and B components are unsigned normalized values that
 *            represent values using sRGB nonlinear encoding, while the A
 *            component (if one exists) is a regular unsigned normalized value
