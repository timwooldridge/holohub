# Holoviz Depth Map Demo

This example shows how to render depth maps in Holoviz.

Depth maps are rectangular 2D arrays where each element represents a depth value. The data is
rendered as a 3D object using points, lines or triangles.
Additionally a 2D array with a color value for each point in the grid can be specified.

Depth maps are rendered in 3D and support camera movement.
The camera is operated using the mouse.
